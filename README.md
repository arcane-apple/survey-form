# survey-form-project
<! My first HTML/CSS project from freeCodeCamp>
<! Involves text inputs, radio inputs, checkbox inputs and textarea inputs>

/* Challenges:   
1. Aligning of labels with input elements.
2. Figuring out why radio inputs are not selected exclusively. (label for = " " has to match input id=" ")
*/
